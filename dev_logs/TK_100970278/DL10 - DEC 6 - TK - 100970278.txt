This week has been very busy - the oral exam went well (we think/hope) and we have a good
idea of what we needed to improve on.

We added a few crucial things to the ui, such as an input for the start location. Saving and
removing classes now works. Mapping of Herzberg is done, and tunnel access to Steacie Building
is being added.
