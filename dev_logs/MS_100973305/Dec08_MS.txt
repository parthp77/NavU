Made one small change to UI

Coding:

	Fixed a bug with the notifications
		-> Problem with the ID of the notification was causing the user to only ever be able to have one ongoing notification
			-> Changed the id to be day(0 or 1) + size*2(size of list of classes, * 2 so that we never have same ID)
